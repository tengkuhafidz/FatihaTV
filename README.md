# FatihaTV

This site's creation was inspired by the observation of how adaptive our local asatizah are in responding to the covid19 situation. Despite the challenges that they are facing, they are hard at work in producing online content and conducting live seminars - to ensure that we can continue to seek for religious knowledge without leaving our homes. May Allah reward their efforts and make it easy for them  

As such, to support their work, my wife and I have curated some of their videos and upcoming live sessions so that we can find them in one place.

This is also my first tech project with my wife - hence the name dedication. :P
