# FatihaTV

This site's creation was inspired by the observation of how adaptive our local asatizah are in responding to the covid19 situation. Despite the challenges that they face, they are hard at work in producing online content and conducting live seminars - simply to ensure that we can continue to seek for religious knowledge from the comfort of our home. May Allah reward their efforts and make it easy for them  

As such, to support their work, my wife and I have curated some of the recorded videos and upcoming live classes that we found for ease of viewing them all in one place.

This is also my first tech project with my wife - hence the name dedication in this project's name. Thank you wifey for layaning! hehe <3
